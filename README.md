~~Helpful~~ Legal Terminology Translator
=============

Chrome extension that replaces everyday English with its unnecessarily eruduite legalese equivalent.

We've all heard the recommendations: 'Write to be understood!' 'Make your texts accessible!' That's all well and good, but for those times that you'd really rather be reading something that reads like a boilerplate legal template from the 19th century, well -- now *everything* can read like that.

With the ~~Helpful~~ Legal Terminology Translator, *all text* loaded in your browser will undergo a conversion from normal, quotidien phraseology to something that more closely resembles an entire discourse of paranonsensicalisms.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag LegaleseTranslator.crx into the page that appears.
